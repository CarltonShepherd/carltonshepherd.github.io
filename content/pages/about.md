Thanks for visiting my site.

I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Information Security Group (ISG), Royal Holloway, University of London](https://isg.rhul.ac.uk). My current research focusses on the use and abuse of trusted execution environments (TEEs), mobile systems security, and practical applications of privacy-enhancing machine learning.

Before my current role, I was a Data Scientist at [Atom Bank](https://www.atombank.co.uk), the UK's first digital bank, where I worked in a small team building high assurance ETL pipelines for Â£3bn+ savings and mortgage reporting. Prior to this, I was a Research Scientist at the [OneSpan](https://www.onespan.com), a NASDAQ-listed financial technology company in Cambridge, UK, where I focussed on secure machine learning for user authentication, KYC and fraud detection. I hold a Ph.D. in Information Security from [Royal Holloway, University of London](https://isg.rhul.ac.uk) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Newcastle University](https://ncl.ac.uk).

My technical skills include:

* Commercial experience in writing production quality code using Python and Java; SQL (Postgres and SQLite); data analysis and machine learning libraries, inc. PyLab, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, and Keras; and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* Trusted execution environments (TEEs), including ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX and the GlobalPlatform specifications.
* Building reliable data-driven systems for security and high assurance applications.
